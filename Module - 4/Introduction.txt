Train and evaluate clustering models

Clustering is the process of grouping objects with similar objects.

A major difference between clustering and classification models is that clustering is an ‘unsupervised’ method, where ‘training’ is done without labels. Instead, models identify examples that have a similar collection of features. In the image above, examples that are in a similar location are grouped together.

Clustering is common and useful for exploring new data where patterns between data points, such as high-level categories, are not yet known. It's used in many fields that need to automatically label complex data, including analysis of social networks, brain connectivity, spam filtering, and so on.
