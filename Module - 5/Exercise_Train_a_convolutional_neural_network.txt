PyTorch and TensorFlow both offer comprehensive support for building convolutional neural networks as classification models for images.

In this exercise, you'll use your preferred framework to create a simple CNN-based image classifier for images of simple geometric shapes. The same principles can be applied to images of any kind.

To complete the exercise:

    In Jupyter, in the ml-basics folder, open the Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch).ipynb or Convolutional Neural Networks (Tensorflow).ipynb notebook, depending on your framework preference, and follow the instructions it contains.

    When you've finished, close and halt all notebooks.

When you've finished working through the notebook, return to this module and move on to the next unit to learn more.
